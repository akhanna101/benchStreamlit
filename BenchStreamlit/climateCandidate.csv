" Here is a summary:

- According to analyses of global climate models, limiting warming to 1.5°C or 2°C requires rapid and deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions across all sectors immediately. 

- Pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C reach net zero CO2 emissions in the early 2050s and net zero GHG emissions around 2070. Those limiting warming to 2°C reach net zero CO2 emissions in the early 2070s. 

- Reaching net zero emissions requires steep reductions in CO2 and non-CO2 emissions like methane. Some emissions will remain and need to be balanced by carbon removal. Net zero CO2 is achieved before net zero GHGs.

- The pathways to net zero emissions involve transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy, improving efficiency, reducing non-CO2 GHGs, and using carbon removal techniques like reforestation. The energy and forestry sectors decarbonize faster than buildings, transport and industry.

- There are synergies between emissions reductions and sustainable development, e.g. renewable energy, reforestation and ecosystem restoration can benefit the environment, economy and society. However, some options like large-scale afforestation or bioenergy crop production can negatively impact biodiversity, food security, and indigenous groups if mismanaged. 

- Pathways with more efficient resource use and sustainable development have fewer challenges like less reliance on carbon removal and less pressure on land and biodiversity.

In summary, keeping warming to 1.5°C or 2°C requires immediate and steep emissions cuts and transitioning to net zero emissions around mid-century. This transition will require rapid decarbonization and balancing remaining emissions through carbon removal techniques. There are opportunities for co-benefits with sustainable development, but also risks of negative impacts if options like biocrop production or afforestation are mismanaged. More sustainable pathways face fewer challenges."
" Here is a summary:

- Effective climate governance and policies are key to successful climate action. This includes political commitment, well-coordinated governance across levels, policies and strategies, and access to finance and technology.

- Clear goals, coordination, and inclusive processes enable effective climate action. Regulations and economic policies can drive deep emissions cuts and resilience if scaled up. 

- Effective governance provides direction, targets, mainstreaming of climate action, monitoring, access to finance and technology, and inclusive and transparent decision making.

- Effective institutions at all levels build consensus, enable coordination, inform strategies, and require capacity. Political will and partnerships across society enhance effectiveness.

- Effective multilevel governance enables mitigation, adaptation, risk management, and resilience. It prioritizes equity, justice, resources, review, and monitoring. Laws, policies, participation, and targeted interventions can reduce vulnerabilities and risks.

- Regulations, economic policies, and carbon pricing can support deep emissions cuts if scaled up, tailored to circumstances, and address equity. Removing fossil fuel subsidies and policy packages can meet economic and emissions goals.

- Diverse knowledge, meaningful participation, and inclusive processes enable climate-resilient development, build capacity, and find locally appropriate solutions. This includes indigenous, local, and scientific knowledge."
" Here is a summary:

- Taking rapid and sustained action on mitigation and adaptation in this decade would reduce projected losses and damages from climate change for both humans and ecosystems. It would also provide many benefits, especially for air quality and health.

- Delaying mitigation and adaptation action would lock in high-emissions infrastructure, increase the risks of stranded assets and escalating costs, reduce feasibility, and increase losses and damages. 

- Near-term actions require high initial investments and potentially disruptive changes, but enabling policies can help address this.

- Rapid and sustained mitigation and accelerated adaptation in this decade would reduce future losses and damages. Adaptation takes time to implement, so accelerated action now is important. Integrating adaptation and mitigation can maximize benefits and minimize trade-offs.

- Delayed action will increase warming, losses, and damages, and push more systems to their limits. It risks higher costs, stranded assets, reduced feasibility of options, and disproportionate impacts on the vulnerable.

- Accelerated climate action provides co-benefits like health benefits from better air quality and diets. Methane cuts limit warming and ozone. Adaptation boosts food security, health, livelihoods, and biodiversity. 

- Economic analysis cannot capture all benefits of avoiding climate change damages. Mitigation benefits often exceed costs. Faster action increases co-benefits, cuts risks and long-term costs, but requires bigger upfront investments.

- Ambitious mitigation needs big, disruptive economic changes with distributional impacts. Policies can moderate impacts, support low-emission growth, provide social protection, improve access to finance, and integrate climate and macroeconomic actions."
" Here is a summary:

- Continued greenhouse gas emissions will lead to increasing global warming, with the best estimate of 1.5°C likely to be reached in the near term (2021-2040) according to considered scenarios and models. 
- Every increment of warming will intensify climate change impacts and hazards (high confidence). 
- Deep and rapid reductions in emissions could slow warming within 20 years and change atmospheric composition within years (high confidence).
- Global warming will continue increasing in the near term, likely reaching 1.5°C even in a low-emissions scenario. Warming will exceed 1.5°C in higher-emissions scenarios (high confidence). 
- Differences in warming trends between scenarios may emerge within 20 years (high confidence). Reductions in pollutants and methane can improve air quality within years (high confidence).
- Continued emissions will further impact the climate system, intensifying the water cycle, monsoons, extreme weather events, reducing natural carbon sinks, melting cryosphere, raising sea levels, increasing ocean acidification (high confidence).
- All regions will face concurrent, intensifying climate change impacts, like compound heatwaves and droughts, more frequent coastal flooding, stronger storms (high confidence). 
- Natural variability will continue to modulate human-caused changes over the short term. A large volcano eruption could temporarily reduce warming for 1-3 years (medium confidence)."
" Here is a summary:

- Finance, technology and international cooperation are critical to achieve climate goals and accelerated climate action. Adaptation and mitigation financing would need to increase significantly to meet climate targets. 

- There is enough global capital to close the investment gap needed for climate action but barriers exist to redirect capital to climate action. Improving access to finance can help build capacity, address limitations, and avoid rising risks, especially for developing countries and vulnerable groups. Public finance can also attract private finance.

- Average yearly investment needed for climate change mitigation is three to six times higher than current levels. Increased investment is needed across all sectors and regions, and even with mitigation action, more resources will be needed for adaptation.

- There are opportunities to close investment gaps, especially in developing countries, but challenges exist, including economic vulnerabilities, indebtedness, and uneven access to affordable finance. Government support and policy changes can help align public and private finance and improve the risk-return profile of climate investments. Financial institutions and central banks can better account for climate risks.

- Technological innovation can provide opportunities for emissions reductions and other benefits but also has risks like environmental harm, inequality, foreign dependence, and rebound effects. Policy support for innovation and technology diffusion, as well as regulation and incentives, can encourage low-emission technology. Technology adoption lags in developing countries due to weaker enabling conditions.

- International cooperation is key for ambitious climate change mitigation, adaptation and climate-resilient development. Cooperation can improve access to finance, especially for developing countries and vulnerable groups, align finance with needs, enable greater ambition, accelerate mitigation and adaptation, and shift to sustainable development pathways. Partnerships and agreements can also support policy, technology diffusion, mitigation and adaptation, though uncertainties remain."
" Here is a summary:

• Climate change poses an urgent threat to humanity and the planet. There is a rapidly closing window to secure a livable future.  

• Climate-resilient development that integrates adaptation and mitigation is urgently needed and enabled by international cooperation, adequate financing, and coordinated policies. Choices made in this decade will have long-lasting impacts.

• Evidence shows climate impacts and risks are more urgent than previously thought. Climate-resilient development is increasingly constrained by past and current climate change, especially beyond 1.5°C warming.  

• Government, civil society, and private sector action at all levels is crucial to shift to sustainable, climate-resilient development. Enabling conditions include political will, coordinated policies, cooperation, knowledge, technology, finance, and inclusive governance.  

• Continued emissions will further disrupt the climate and environment. Without urgent action, climate change threatens ecosystems, biodiversity, livelihoods, health, and future generations. Many changes will be irreversible for centuries or more.

• In summary, the window for action is rapidly closing but still possible. Urgent, effective, and equitable mitigation and adaptation are needed through an all-of-society approach to build climate-resilient development pathways. The time for action is now."
" Here is a summary:

- Human activities, primarily the emission and accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, have unequivocally caused the planet to warm by about 1°C since pre-industrial times (before 1850-1900). The rate of warming has accelerated since 1970.  

- The total human-caused global surface temperature increase from 1850-1900 to 2010-2019 is estimated to be between 0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate of 1.07°C. Greenhouse gases have caused 1-2°C of warming, while other human factors like aerosols have caused 0-0.8°C of cooling. Natural factors and internal variability have caused little net change.

- Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide are higher than in at least the past 800,000 years due to human emissions and activities. About 42% of all carbon dioxide emissions since 1850 have occurred since 1990.  

- Global greenhouse gas emissions were about 54% higher in 2019 than in 1990, and about 12% higher than in 2010. The largest source is carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels and industrial production, followed by methane. Although emissions growth has slowed, it remains at record high levels. About 79% of emissions come from the energy, industry, transport, and building sectors.  

- Historical greenhouse gas emissions and contributions to climate change vary dramatically between regions and countries. About 35% of the population lives in high-emitting countries, while 41% live in low-emitting countries, some of which lack access to modern energy. The least developed countries and small island developing states have much lower per capita emissions than the global average. The highest-income households contribute disproportionately more emissions than lower-income households."
" Here is a summary:

• Limiting global warming to 1.5°C or 2°C requires reaching net zero CO2 emissions and strong reductions in other greenhouse gases. 

• For every 1000 Gt of CO2 emitted, global temperatures rise by 0.45°C. 

• The remaining carbon budget for a 50% chance of limiting warming to 1.5°C is 500 GtCO2. For a 67% chance of limiting warming to 2°C, it is 1150 GtCO2. Reducing non-CO2 emissions can help stay within these budgets.

• If CO2 emissions stay at 2019 levels through 2030, the 1.5°C budget will almost be used up and over a third of the 2°C budget will be depleted.

• Emissions from existing fossil fuel infrastructure will exceed the 1.5°C budget and match the 2°C budget. 

• Historical emissions from 1850 to 2019 were about 4/5 of the 1.5°C budget and 2/3 of the 2°C budget.

• Carbon dioxide removal will be needed to achieve net negative CO2 emissions. Reaching net zero emissions can cause temperatures to gradually decline after peaking.

• The sooner large emission reductions are achieved, the less the world will have to rely on carbon dioxide removal. The scale of required reductions depends on how fast they are achieved.

Does this summary accurately reflect the key points about carbon budgets and the importance of reaching net zero emissions? Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand my summary in any way."
" Here is a summary:

• Mitigation and adaptation actions to address climate change have more synergies than trade-offs with sustainable development. Synergies and trade-offs depend on the context and scale of implementation. 

• Embedding mitigation in development can increase the pace and scale of emission reductions. Development priorities depend on each country's circumstances. Transitioning economies dependent on fossil fuels require policies to diversify their economies and energy sectors to mitigate risks, with considerations of just transitions. Poverty eradication and improved living standards in low-emitting countries can occur without major emissions growth.

• Many mitigation and adaptation actions have synergies with sustainable development goals (SDGs), but some can have trade-offs. Synergies outweigh trade-offs, which depend on the pace of change and development context. Trade-offs can be minimized through capacity building, finance, governance, technology transfer, investments, development, gender equity, and including vulnerable groups. 

• Implementing mitigation and adaptation together, while considering trade-offs, provides health and well-being co-benefits. For example, clean energy and transport can improve air quality, health, jobs, energy security, and equity."
" Here is a summary:

• Climate change impacts and risks are projected to escalate significantly with every increment of global warming. Risks are higher at 1.5°C warming compared to today, and higher still at 2°C warming. 

• In the near-term, all regions are projected to face increases in climate hazards like heat waves, heavy rain, droughts, and sea level rise. These will pose risks to humans, ecosystems, and infrastructure. 

• Long-term climate change impacts are projected to be many times higher than what we see today. Sea level rise risks will continue beyond 2100.

• Risks will become more complex and difficult to manage as climate change interacts with other factors like urban growth, disease, and conflict. 

• Vulnerability to climate change depends on both climate hazards and societal factors like urbanization, inequality, and ecosystem health. Vulnerability will increase in informal settlements and for those dependent on natural resources.

• Ecosystem loss and degradation has cascading impacts on people, especially Indigenous groups and local communities who directly rely on ecosystems to meet basic needs.

• Risks escalate non-linearly with warming and are concentrated at lower levels of warming due to new evidence of observed impacts and improved scientific understanding.

• Unavoidable sea level rise means coastal risks will continue to rise long after 2100.

That covers the key highlights and main takeaways regarding escalating climate change impacts and risks with global warming according to the IPCC report. Please let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of this summary."
" Here is a summary:

• Adaptation planning and implementation has progressed in all sectors and regions, providing benefits, though effectiveness varies. However, adaptation gaps remain and are growing. Some limits to adaptation have been reached. Maladaptation is also happening in some areas. 

• Adaptation is providing benefits, with many examples of effective options that reduce risks, though responses tend to be fragmented, incremental, sector-specific, and unequal. Adaptation gaps remain, especially for vulnerable groups.

• Some areas are experiencing “soft limits” to adaptation due to financial, governance and other constraints. Some ecosystems have reached “hard limits.” Adaptation cannot prevent all losses and damages.

• Key barriers to adaptation include lack of resources, lack of private sector and public engagement, lack of finance, low climate literacy, lack of political commitment, limited research use, and lack of urgency. Adaptation finance remains insufficient, constraining adaptation especially in developing countries. Impacts can also reduce available finance by causing losses and damages.

• In summary, while progress is being made, adaptation gaps and challenges remain significant, especially for developing countries and vulnerable groups. More action and support are needed to enhance adaptation planning and implementation."
" Here is a summary:

• There have been widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere due to human-caused climate change. This has led to adverse impacts on nature and people, especially vulnerable communities. 

• It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the climate system. Global mean sea level has risen 0.20 m between 1901 and 2018, with an accelerating rate of rise. Human influence has also increased the frequency and severity of some extreme weather events.

• Billions of people live in contexts highly vulnerable to climate change. Weather and climate extremes have reduced food and water security, especially in vulnerable regions and populations. Between 2010 and 2020, climate-related disasters caused much higher mortality in highly vulnerable regions compared to less vulnerable regions.

• Climate change has caused substantial, and in some cases irreversible, damage to ecosystems, including local species extinctions. Impacts on some ecosystems like glaciers and permafrost are approaching irreversibility. 

• Climate change has reduced agricultural productivity growth, food security and water security, hampering sustainable development. Ocean warming and acidification have harmed some fisheries and aquaculture. Many people experience severe water scarcity due to climate change and other factors.

• In all regions, climate change has increased mortality and morbidity from extreme heat events, food/water-borne and vector-borne diseases, and some mental health issues. Climate change is also increasingly driving displacement, especially in vulnerable populations. 

• Climate change has caused widespread harm to people and nature, with unequally distributed losses and damages across systems, regions and sectors. Impacts include economic damages, health effects, destruction of property, and disrupted livelihoods, with disproportionate effects on disadvantaged groups.

• In cities, climate change has compromised infrastructure, transportation, water/sanitation systems, health, and livelihoods. Impacts tend to be concentrated among marginalized groups."
" Here is a summary:

- Human activities, primarily the emission and accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, have unequivocally caused the Earth’s surface temperature to increase by about 1.1°C since 1850-1900. Global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise due to unsustainable energy use, land use changes, and consumption patterns across the world. 

- The likely range of human-caused warming from 1850-1900 to 2010-2019 is 0.8°C to 1.3°C. Greenhouse gases have contributed 1.0°C to 2.0°C of warming, while other human factors and natural drivers have caused between -0.2°C to 0.3°C of change. Atmospheric CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide are at their highest levels in at least 800,000 years.

- Global greenhouse gas emissions were 59 billion tonnes of CO2-equivalent in 2019, 12% higher than in 2010 and 54% higher than in 1990. The largest growth and share of emissions come from CO2 from burning fossil fuels, followed by methane. Emissions are growing at a slowing rate but are still the highest in history. About 79% of emissions come from energy, industry, transport and buildings. 

- Historical greenhouse gas emissions vary greatly by region and per capita. About 35% of the population lives in high-emitting countries (over 9 tonnes of CO2 per capita) while 41% live in low-emitting countries (under 3 tonnes per capita). The least developed countries and small island states have much lower per capita emissions than the global average. The highest-emitting 10% of households contribute 34-45% of emissions while the lowest-emitting 50% contribute 13-15%."
" Here is a summary:

- There have been widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere due to human-caused climate change. This has led to adverse impacts on nature and people, especially vulnerable communities. 

- Sea levels have risen 0.2 meters from 1901 to 2018 due to human influence. The rate of sea level rise has increased over time. There is also evidence that human influence has increased the frequency and severity of heatwaves, heavy rain, droughts, and tropical cyclones. Human influence has also likely increased the chance of compound extreme events like concurrent heatwaves and droughts.

- 3.3 to 3.6 billion people live in highly vulnerable areas that are impacted by climate change. The largest impacts have been seen in Africa, Asia, Central and South America, small island states, the Arctic, and for Indigenous groups and low-income communities. Mortality from climate-related disasters was 15 times higher in highly vulnerable regions compared to less vulnerable regions between 2010 to 2020.

- Climate change has caused substantial and irreversible damage to ecosystems including through increased heat extremes, permafrost thaw, glacial retreat, and ocean warming and acidification. Hundreds of local species extinctions have been linked to increases in heat extremes. Some impacts are approaching irreversibility.

- Climate change has reduced food security and water security, hindering sustainable development. While agricultural productivity has increased overall, climate change has slowed growth in some regions. Ocean changes have reduced food from fisheries and shellfish in some areas. Roughly half the world faces severe seasonal water scarcity due to climate and non-climate factors.

- In all regions, increases in extreme heat have caused health issues and deaths. The occurrence of climate-related diseases and vector-borne diseases has increased. Mental health issues and displacement have also been linked to climate change in some regions.

- Climate change has caused widespread losses and damages to people and nature with unequal distribution. Economic damages have been detected in climate-exposed sectors like agriculture, forestry, fisheries, energy, and tourism. Livelihoods and well-being have been impacted in many ways including through destruction of infrastructure and property, health and food security issues, and effects on social equity.  

- In cities, climate change has caused health, livelihood and infrastructure issues, especially for marginalized groups. Hot extremes have intensified in cities. Infrastructure like transport, water, sanitation and energy have been compromised, leading to economic losses, service disruptions and well-being issues."
" Here is a summary:

• Adaptation planning and implementation has progressed in all sectors and regions, leading to many benefits. However, there are still adaptation gaps that will continue to grow without increased action. Some ecosystems and regions have reached limits to adaptation. There are also some cases of maladaptation. 

• Examples of effective adaptation options include:  agricultural innovations; water management; ecosystem management; disaster risk management; and social safety nets. However, most adaptation is fragmented, incremental, sector-specific, and unequal.

• Marginalized and vulnerable groups are most affected by maladaptation. Some small farmers and coastal communities have reached soft limits to adaptation due to lack of resources and support. Hard limits have been reached in some ecosystems. Adaptation cannot prevent all losses and damages.

• Barriers to adaptation include lack of resources, lack of private/citizen engagement, lack of finance and research, lack of political will, and lack of urgency. Adaptation costs are much higher than current funding. Most adaptation finance comes from public sources, with little from private sources. Current funding is insufficient, especially for developing countries. Climate change impacts can also reduce available funding by causing economic losses and damages.

• In summary, while progress is being made, adaptation gaps and limits suggest that increased action and support are urgently needed, especially for vulnerable regions, ecosystems and populations. More adaptation funding, engagement, research, and political will can help address current barriers. But adaptation alone may not be enough, and loss and damage will still occur in some cases. Mitigation is also critical to lessen long-term climate change and impacts."
" Here is a summary:

• There has been progress in climate change mitigation policies and laws since the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) in 2014. However, the policies and nationally determined contributions (NDCs) that countries have implemented so far are insufficient to limit global warming to 1.5°C or 2°C. 
• The UNFCCC, Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement have driven countries to develop climate change mitigation policies and set emissions reduction targets. Many countries have successfully implemented policies to improve energy efficiency, reduce deforestation and deploy new technologies which have avoided some greenhouse gas emissions. However, global emissions continue to rise.
• Several mitigation options like solar and wind energy, electric vehicles, and improved land management have become more cost effective and viable. Policies have helped reduce costs and increase deployment of these options. In some places, transitioning to low-emission systems may be cheaper than maintaining emission-intensive systems.  
• There is a large “emissions gap” between the greenhouse gas emissions projected from implemented policies and NDCs and the emissions levels needed to limit warming to 1.5°C or 2°C. NDCs announced before COP26 would likely lead to 2.8°C of warming by 2100. While many countries aim for net zero emissions by 2050, there are limited policies in place to achieve this.  
• Policy coverage and implementation varies between sectors. Projected emissions from current policies in 2030 exceed emissions from NDCs, indicating an “implementation gap.” Without strengthened policies, 3.2°C of warming is projected by 2100.
• Adoption of low-emission technologies is limited in developing countries due to lack of finance, technology transfer, and capacity. While climate finance has increased, it falls short of what is needed to meet climate goals, especially for adaptation. The majority of climate finance goes to mitigation. Developed countries have not yet met their goal to mobilize $100 billion per year in climate finance for developing countries."
" Here is a summary:

• Continued greenhouse gas emissions will lead to increasing global warming, with a likely exceedance of 1.5°C in the near term (2021-2040) under higher emissions scenarios. Stabilizing at 1.5°C requires deep, rapid and sustained reductions in emissions.

• Discernible differences in global warming trends would emerge within 20 years between lower and higher emissions scenarios. Effects on greenhouse gas concentrations and air quality would emerge sooner.

• Continued emissions will intensify changes across the climate system. This includes changes in extremes, the water cycle, natural land and ocean carbon sinks, the cryosphere, sea levels and ocean conditions. 

• With further warming, regions will experience concurrent and multiple climate change impacts. This includes more frequent compound heatwaves and droughts, as well as annual extreme sea level events in many locations by 2100. Other regional changes include intensifying storms, increasing aridity and wildfires.

• Natural variability will continue to modulate human-caused changes, either enhancing or reducing projected changes over the near term. Large volcanic eruptions could temporarily mask warming for a few years.

• Adaptation will need to account for natural variability, regional impacts, and changes that emerge on shorter timescales. Mitigation can avoid increasing changes over longer timescales.

That covers the essence of the provided summary on projected future climate change and its consequences according to the latest science. Please let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of this summary."
" Here is a summary:

• Climate change risks and impacts are increasing with every increment of warming. Risks are higher at 1.5°C and 2°C compared to present.

• In the near-term, there will be increases in hazards like heatwaves, floods, droughts, and sea level rise, leading to risks for ecosystems, health, food production, etc. These risks are present in all regions. 

• Risks at higher levels of warming will be complex and difficult to manage due to interactions between climate and non-climate factors like urbanization, inequality, etc. Risks will cascade across sectors and regions.

• Vulnerability to climate change depends on socioeconomic factors like migration, development, reliance on natural resources, etc. Vulnerable groups include informal settlements, rural populations, Indigenous peoples, and ecosystems.  

• Loss of ecosystems and their services has long-term impacts, especially for vulnerable groups who directly depend on them. Ecosystem loss is being driven by factors like overconsumption, population growth, and land mismanagement.

• Risks continue to increase beyond 2100 due to committed climate change like sea level rise. Adaptation has limits.

• Compared to previous assessments, risks are now seen as higher at lower levels of warming due to new evidence of impacts and a better understanding of vulnerabilities. Many risks are greater than previously thought.

So in summary, with every degree of warming, climate risks grow in severity and complexity. Vulnerable populations and ecosystems face the greatest threats, and risks continue to escalate over long timescales due to unavoidable changes. Risks are now understood to be higher than previously assessed, even at lower levels of warming. Urgent action is needed to reduce vulnerabilities and limit warming to avoid catastrophic consequences."
" Here is a summary:

• Some future climate changes are unavoidable and irreversible but rapid reductions in greenhouse gas emissions can limit them. The likelihood and impacts of abrupt or irreversible changes increase with higher global warming. 

• Limiting global warming to 1.5°C or 2°C will not stop sea level rise for centuries to millennia due to deep ocean warming and ice melt. Sea levels will remain elevated for thousands of years but rapid emissions cuts can slow further acceleration and long-term sea level rise. With 1.5°C of warming, sea levels may rise 0.15-0.23 m by 2050 and 0.28-0.55 m by 2100. With 2°C of warming, sea levels may rise 0.20-0.29 m by 2050 and 0.63-1.01 m by 2100. Over 2000 years, sea levels may rise 2-3 m with 1.5°C of warming and 2-6 m with 2°C of warming.

• The risks of species loss, irreversible biodiversity loss in ecosystems like forests, coral reefs and the Arctic, and abrupt changes increase with higher warming. At 2-3°C of warming, the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets are likely to be lost irreversibly over millennia, causing up to several meters of sea level rise. The probability and rate of ice loss increase with higher temperatures.

• The likelihood of low-probability, high-impact outcomes increases with greater warming due to uncertainties like ice sheet processes. Global sea level rise above the likely range, up to 2 m by 2100 and 15 m by 2300, is possible with very high emissions. The Atlantic Ocean circulation may collapse abruptly but likely not before 2100. If it did, it would cause abrupt regional weather shifts and major ecosystem and human impacts."
" Here is a summary:

- Adaptation options that are effective today will become less effective as the world continues to warm. With increasing global warming, losses and damages will rise, and more natural and human systems will reach their limits to adapt. 

- The effectiveness of many adaptation options, including those focused on ecosystems and water resources, will decrease with increasing warming. Integrated, multi-sectoral solutions tailored to climate risks and addressing social inequities can increase the feasibility and effectiveness of options. Long-term planning also helps.

- Additional global warming will make losses, damages, and limits to adaptation increasingly unavoidable, especially for vulnerable groups. Above 1.5°C of warming, limited freshwater and threats to ecosystems like coral reefs and wetlands will pose hard limits to adaptation for some areas. 

- Short-term actions focused on isolated sectors or risks often lead to maladaptation, creating long-term vulnerabilities that are hard to change. For example, seawalls reduce impacts short-term but can increase long-term exposure if not part of an adaptive plan. Maladaptation can worsen inequities and harm ecosystems. 

- Maladaptation can be avoided through flexible, multi-sectoral, inclusive, long-term planning and adaptation actions providing co-benefits across systems.

In summary, adaptation has limits, especially as climate change intensifies. Overly narrow or short-term approaches risk maladaptation and missing opportunities for co-benefits. Integrated long-term planning is needed to build resilience while avoiding harm. But some changes, especially at higher levels of warming, will be unavoidably damaging. Urgent action is needed to minimize these climate change impacts and help the world adapt."
" Here is a summary:

• Limiting global warming to 1.5°C or 2°C requires reaching net zero CO2 emissions and reducing other greenhouse gas emissions. Net zero CO2 emissions means the CO2 emitted by human activity is balanced by the CO2 removed from the atmosphere. 

• The total amount of CO2 emitted until net zero CO2 emissions are reached and the level of emissions reductions this decade will determine whether 1.5°C or 2°C of warming can be achieved. Existing fossil fuel infrastructure would exceed the remaining 1.5°C carbon budget without additional measures.

• For every 1,000 billion tons of CO2 emitted, global temperature rises about 0.45°C. The remaining carbon budget for a 50% chance of limiting warming to 1.5°C is about 500 billion tons of CO2. The budget for a 67% chance of limiting warming to 2°C is about 1,150 billion tons. Reducing non-CO2 emissions can help meet budgets or limit warming.

• If CO2 emissions stay at 2019 levels through 2030, the remaining 1.5°C carbon budget would nearly be used up, and more than a third of the 2°C budget would be depleted. Projected emissions from existing fossil fuel infrastructure exceed the 1.5°C budget and equal about 83% of the 2°C budget.  

• Roughly four-fifths of the total 1.5°C carbon budget and two-thirds of the 2°C budget have already been emitted historically between 1850 and 2019, according to central estimates."
" Here is a summary:

• According to global climate models, limiting global warming to 1.5°C or 2°C requires immediate and deep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions across all sectors.  

• Pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C reach net zero CO2 emissions around 2050 and net zero GHG emissions around 2070. Those limiting to 2°C reach net zero CO2 emissions around 2070.

• Reaching net zero emissions requires reducing CO2 emissions as well as other GHGs like methane. Some hard-to-abate emissions will remain and need to be counterbalanced by carbon dioxide removal methods.  

• The transition to net zero emissions involves moving from fossil fuels to renewable energy, improving efficiency, reducing non-CO2 GHGs, and using carbon dioxide removal methods like reforestation. The energy and land sectors can reach net zero faster than buildings, industry and transport.

• The options for reducing emissions and reaching net zero can complement sustainable development in some ways, e.g. through renewable energy, reforestation and soil carbon sequestration. However, some options like large-scale afforestation can also have adverse impacts on biodiversity, food security, and Indigenous rights. 

• Pathways that emphasize efficiency and sustainability include fewer challenges like less dependence on carbon dioxide removal and less pressure on land and biodiversity."
" Here's a summary:

- Exceeding 1.5°C warming (overshoot) is potentially reversible but requires achieving net negative CO2 emissions by deploying carbon dioxide removal on a large scale. This raises feasibility and sustainability concerns. 

- Overshoot leads to adverse and irreversible impacts that increase with the magnitude and duration of overshooting. These include impacts to ecosystems, infrastructure, and coastal areas.

- The larger the overshoot, the more net negative CO2 emissions are needed to return to 1.5°C. Transitioning to net zero CO2 emissions faster and reducing non-CO2 emissions can limit overshoot and decrease the need for large-scale CO2 removal.

- Only a few modelled pathways limit warming to 1.5°C by 2100 without temporarily exceeding it. Sustaining net negative CO2 emissions can gradually reduce warming but is challenging due to feedback effects like wildfires that weaken carbon sinks and increase emissions.

- Overshooting exposes societies and ecosystems to greater climatic changes and risks over longer periods of time. Impacts to ecosystems with low resilience may be irreversible.

In summary, overshooting 1.5°C warming is potentially reversible but difficult and risky, with adverse consequences that worsen with the degree and length of overshoot. Rapidly reducing emissions and limiting overshoot is critical to decreasing risks and irreversible impacts."
" Here is a summary:

- There is urgent need for integrated climate action within this decade to secure a sustainable future. The choices made now will have long-lasting impacts. 

- Climate change poses severe threats to human and planetary well-being. The window for action is rapidly closing. Climate-resilient development that integrates mitigation and adaptation is critical and enabled by international cooperation, adequate financing, and good governance.

- Evidence shows climate impacts and risks are worse than previously assessed. Climate-resilient development pathways are increasingly constrained, especially if warming exceeds 1.5°C. Urgent action is needed.

- Governments, civil society, and the private sector must work together across levels and sectors to enable climate-resilient development by prioritizing risk reduction, equity, and justice and integrating decision making and actions. Enabling conditions include political will, coordinated policies, cooperation, ecosystem protection, inclusive governance, knowledge, technology, monitoring, financing, and support for vulnerable groups.

- Without urgent mitigation and adaptation, climate change will irreversibly worsen, threatening ecosystems, biodiversity, livelihoods, health, and well-being across generations. Continued emissions will further disrupt the climate system.

In summary, the key message is that we must act now in an integrated, equitable, and urgent fashion to enable climate-resilient development and a sustainable future. The need for action across society is increasingly pressing, as climate impacts worsen and options narrow. Together, we can change development pathways, but the window for action is rapidly closing."
" Here is a summary:

- Taking rapid and sustained climate action this decade by reducing emissions and adapting to climate change can significantly lower future losses and damages to humans and ecosystems. There is very high confidence in this.
- Delaying climate action will increase climate change impacts, losses and damages, and make adaptation and mitigation more difficult and expensive. There is high confidence in this. 
- Acting now to mitigate and adapt to climate change can provide many benefits, like improved health and air quality. There is high confidence in this.
- While the costs of climate action are high, the benefits of avoided climate change damages are likely higher. However, cost-benefit analyses remain limited. There is medium confidence in this.
- Ambitious climate action will require major changes to economies that can disrupt some industries. Policy changes and safety nets can help address these disruptions. There is high confidence in this.

In summary, the key message is that taking urgent action now to reduce emissions and adapt to climate change will substantially lower future harm, provide benefits beyond climate mitigation, and support a just transition to more sustainable economies. Delay will only increase damages, costs, and difficulties."
" Here is a summary:

- Rapid and large-scale transitions across all systems and sectors are required to achieve deep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change. Feasible and cost-effective options for mitigation and adaptation already exist but differ across regions and systems. 

- Achieving these transitions will require large-scale changes but are not unprecedented in speed. Options include deploying low-carbon technologies; reducing energy demand; protecting ecosystems; and social and behavioral changes.

- For the energy system, transitions require reducing fossil fuel use, increasing renewable energy, improving efficiency, and integrating energy systems. Low-cost options include solar and wind power, energy efficiency, and reducing methane emissions. Adaptation options improve infrastructure resilience and energy reliability.

- For industry and transport, options include improving efficiency, using sustainable biofuels and hydrogen, electrifying vehicles, and circular material flows. 

- For cities and settlements, options include compact urban design, public transit, energy-efficient buildings, reducing consumption, and green infrastructure. Integrated planning and infrastructure can provide mitigation, adaptation, and well-being benefits.  

- For land, ocean, food, and water systems, options include conservation, restoration, and improved management of forests and ecosystems. Reducing deforestation, sustainable agriculture, diet shifts, and reducing food waste offer benefits. Ecosystem-based adaptation reduces climate risks and provides co-benefits.  

- Protecting 30-50% of Earth's natural areas is needed to maintain biodiversity and ecosystem services. Conservation, restoration, and management help ecosystems adapt and mitigate climate change, reduce coastal risks, and increase carbon storage. Rebuilding fisheries and land restoration provide benefits. Indigenous rights and cooperation are integral.

- Health systems can benefit from mainstreaming health into policies, strengthening public health, increasing health system resilience, protecting ecosystem health, improving water security, early warning systems for health risks, vaccine development, mental health support, and heat action plans. Reducing food waste and balanced diets provide health and environmental co-benefits.  

- Policy options like insurance, social protection, finance tools, early warning systems, disaster risk management, climate services, education, and community approaches can reduce climate risks and support adaptation."
" Here is a summary:

- Mitigation and adaptation actions to address climate change have more synergies than trade-offs with achieving sustainable development. However, synergies and trade-offs depend on the context and scale of implementation. 

- Mitigation efforts within wider development policies can increase the pace and scale of emission reductions. Different countries and regions have different development priorities based on their circumstances. For regions dependent on fossil fuels, transitioning to lower emissions requires economic diversification and just transition principles. Eradicating poverty in low-emitting countries can be achieved without major global emission increases.

- Many mitigation and adaptation actions have synergies with sustainable development goals (SDGs), but some also have trade-offs. Synergies outweigh trade-offs, but depend on the scale of change and development context. Trade-offs can be minimized by building capacity, providing finance and technology transfer, and considering equity and participation of vulnerable groups.

- Implementing mitigation and adaptation together can provide health and well-being co-benefits. For example, clean energy access improves health, especially for women and children. Shifting to public and active transport, and clean energy can improve air quality, health, jobs, energy security, and equity.

In summary, while climate change mitigation and adaptation actions largely synergize with sustainable development, the outcomes depend on the specific actions and context. Coordinating climate and development policies, building capacity, and minimizing trade-offs can help maximize co-benefits and meet multiple goals. But a transition to low-emissions and resilient development must consider the circumstances of different countries and peoples."
" Here is a summary:

- Prioritizing equity, social justice and inclusion can enable ambitious climate change mitigation and adaptation actions, as well as climate-resilient development. 

- Adaptation outcomes are better for the most vulnerable people and regions when there is a focus on equity, inclusion and rights. Integrating adaptation into social programs can increase resilience, especially for marginalized groups.

- Regions and 3-3.6 billion people with major development challenges have high vulnerability to climate hazards. Their adaptation is enhanced by approaches focusing on equity, inclusion and rights. Vulnerability is made worse by inequality related to gender, ethnicity, income, disability, age, etc.

- Policies and economic tools can advance equity. High-income individuals contribute more emissions and have more potential for reductions. Reducing emission-intensive consumption can have benefits. Options include socio-cultural changes, behavior and lifestyle changes with policy, infrastructure and tech support. 

- Many people lack access to modern energy. Tech, funding and capacity building can help developing regions transition to low-emissions systems, with many benefits.

- Equitable, just and inclusive actions can reconcile different interests and worldviews for equitable outcomes.

The key messages are that equity, social justice and inclusion should be priorities in climate change mitigation, adaptation and development. Vulnerable groups should be focused on. Policies and actions are needed to change behaviors and reduce emissions in an equitable manner. International support is required for developing regions. Overall, working together in equitable ways can lead to the best outcomes."
" Here is a summary:

- Effective climate governance is essential for enabling mitigation and adaptation actions. It provides leadership and direction, promotes mainstreaming of climate policy across sectors, enhances monitoring and access to finance, and prioritizes inclusive decision making.  

- Effective institutions at multiple levels of government build consensus and coordinate climate action, but they require adequate capacity. Collaboration with civil society actors and partnerships across groups in society enhances effectiveness. Political commitment and partnerships are key.

- Effective multilevel governance for climate change promotes equity, justice and inclusiveness. It allocates appropriate resources, reviews institutions, monitors and evaluates. Laws, policies and participatory processes can reduce climate change vulnerabilities and risks, especially for disadvantaged groups.

- Regulatory and economic policy instruments, if scaled up and widely applied, can support deep emissions reductions. Regulatory instruments are effective for sectoral mitigation. Carbon pricing reduces emissions for low-cost measures, but higher prices are needed for deeper cuts. Addressing equity impacts is important. Fossil fuel subsidy removal reduces emissions but can impact the poor, requiring mitigation. Comprehensive policy packages can balance economic and emissions goals.

- Inclusive processes that draw on diverse knowledge, including indigenous and local knowledge, enable climate-resilient development, build capacity, and identify locally appropriate solutions. Meaningful participation and engagement are key."
" Here is a summary:

• Increased finance is critical to achieve climate change mitigation and adaptation goals. Both public and private finance need to increase significantly to meet the investment needs for mitigation and adaptation, especially in developing countries.  

• There is enough global capital to meet climate finance needs but there are barriers to redirecting capital to climate action. Governments and financial actors need to address these barriers by providing policy signals, reducing risks, and aligning financial flows.

• Finance gaps are largest in developing countries. Increased financial support from developed countries is critical to enhance climate action in developing countries and address inequities. Options to increase finance include increased public finance, public guarantees, capital market development and international cooperation. 

• Technology innovation and adoption need to accelerate, especially in developing countries. Policy packages, incentives, and support for R&D and training can drive low-emission innovation and technology diffusion. But technology also has trade-offs that require governance.

• International cooperation on finance, technology and capacity building is key to enabling more ambitious climate action and achieving climate-resilient development. This includes support for NDCs, technology diffusion, and transnational partnerships. International institutions and agreements are also helping to stimulate low-carbon investments and emissions reductions.

• In summary, finance, technology, and international cooperation can accelerate climate action if barriers are addressed. Ambitious climate goals require massive increases in finance, especially for developing countries. Technology innovation and diffusion must accelerate while managing trade-offs. And international cooperation is critical for enabling more ambitious action."
